								<h3>CODE OF CONDUCT</h3>
								<p>Khalil Parkar<br/>President & CEO</p>
								<p><strong>MEX Canada</strong> has established high standard for its employees, consultants and suppliers to live by in the conduct of its business activities. The violation of this Code of Conduct policy can lead to immediate employment or consultant termination without notice or severance. For suppliers it can result in contract cancellation, termination or penalties. The Code of Conduct concerns the following:</p>
								<p>
									Drug or alcohol abuse
									<br/>Threats or acts of violence
									<br/>Ignorance of general standards and practices
									<br/>Harassment
									<br/>Moral turpitude
									<br/>Violation of health, environment and safety standards
									<br/>Violation of equal opportunity standards
									<br/>Conflicts of interest
									<br/>Dissemination of confidential information
									<br/>Conduct of corrupt practices
									<br/>Failure to administer the Code of Conduct
								</p>
								<p><strong>MEX Canada</strong> employees, consultants and suppliers are responsible to review and understand this Code of Conduct guiding principles and policy.</p>
								<h3>CODE OF CONDUCT POLICY - GUIDING PRINCIPLES</h3>
								<p>Our employees and the way we conduct business are central to achieving MEX Canada Mission, living up to our Values and following our Guiding Principles for doing business.<br/>
<strong>MEX Canada</strong>’s Guiding Principles for doing business are based on our Mission and Values and confirm our commitment to responsible business practices in all the communities in which we work. These Guiding Principles form the backbone of our Code of Conduct. They are the basis for our relationships in the diverse countries and cultures where we live and conduct business, and reflect our responsibility to protect the interests and well being of both present and future generations. <strong>MEX Canada</strong> employees should understand these principles and be guided by them at work.</p>
								<h3>ETHICS AND VALUES</h3>
								<p>We will conduct our business openly, with honesty, integrity and trust. We will respect human rights in all of our activities. We will obey the law and we will operate in accordance with the highest ethical standards; and we will expect the same from our partners, contractors and suppliers.</p>
								<h3>COMMUNITY INITIATIVES</h3>
								<p>We will encourage advancements in civil society wherever we conduct business. We will be sensitive to the culture, context and needs of local communities and strive to make the community a better place to live and conduct business. We will support humanitarian initiatives that promote health, education and economic well being in communities where we work. We will encourage employee involvement in community programs and socially responsible activities.</p>
								<h3>ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
								<p>We will develop natural resources and projects in an efficient and environmentally responsible manner.</p>
								<h3>WORKPLACE ISSUES</h3>
								<p>We will provide a safe and secure working environment. We will provide access to health care for our employees and their families, and, as appropriate, help neighbouring communities meet basic public health needs. We will seek a diverse base of employees and ensure equal opportunity to all qualified individuals in recruiting, compensation, professional development, promotion, and other employment practices. We will ensure that a significant percentage of our employees, managers, contractors, and suppliers in international operations are citizens of the host country.
We will provide a supportive working environment in which all employees may freely contribute.</p>
								<h3>BUILDING ON OUR VALUES</h3>
								<p><strong>MEX Canada</strong> strives to implement its Mission and Values and Guiding Principles through its daily operations. To achieve this aspiration, we will meet compliance requirements and have in place a range of corporate policies and standards, and monitoring and reporting systems. We also provide training and practical guidance to help employees meet these standards.<br/><br/>
 
<strong>MEX Canada</strong> is committed to ethical business practices, a safe workplace, environmental responsibility, compliance with the law and improving the communities in which we work. 
Our Code of Conduct reflects our company's core values and high ethical standards. This code applies to all of the company's directors, officers and employees.</p>
								<h3>Code of Conduct - Drugs & Alcohol</h3>
								<p>Because drug and alcohol abuse can have serious safety and job performance consequences and can involve criminal conduct, <strong>MEX Canada</strong> demands a drug and alcohol impairment-free working environment. This standard applies to all Company employees while they are on <strong>MEX Canada</strong> property or while they are at work off <strong>MEX Canada</strong> property.<br/><br/>
								Employees who report for duty with illegal drugs in their system or report with levels of alcohol or other chemical substances that could impair performance are subject to disciplinary action including immediate dismissal. Employees who experience significant work performance problems or who become involved in significant incidents or accidents are subject to discharge if medical tests show that such employees have controlled substances in their system. Also subject to discharge are employees who, while on duty or on company property, distribute, sell, buy, manufacture, dispense, possess or use illegal drugs.<br/><br/>
								The Human Resources department shall provide management with guidelines for the administration of MEX Canada’s drug and alcohol abuse standards and practices. Drug and Alcohol Program Guidebook will be available from the Human Resources department, which will provide procedures for the inspection, when appropriate, of personal effects on company property and for the administration, when appropriate, of tests approved by the Company’s Medical Director. These guidelines provide for the same general procedures to be followed for contractors or other persons who enter MEX Canada’s property.<br/><br/>
								Any <strong>MEX Canada</strong> employee who believes he or she may be experiencing problems with drug or alcohol abuse is urged to inquire about the company's Employee Assistance Program. Details regarding this rehabilitation program will be available from human resources personnel or by directly contacting the Employee Assistance Program. Such contact is kept confidential.<br/><br/>
								<i>The Human Resources department shall also provide guidelines for serving alcohol at company related functions. Those guidelines will be available from the Human Resources department.</i></p>
								
								<h3>Violence and Threats of Violence</h3>
								<p>Violence and threats of violence (TOV) are unacceptable and should be reported immediately to your supervisor or the Human Resources department. In the event of an imminent threat, employees should first contact local authorities and/or your facility's security. A report should also be made to one of the following: the Human Resource department, or the Compliance Alert Line. Procedures shall be instituted to provide confidentiality. Every report of violence or a threat of violence will be investigated and appropriate action will be taken. Employees who engage in violence or threaten violence are subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment, as well as criminal prosecution.</p>
								<h3>General Practices and Standards</h3>
								<p><strong>MEX Canada</strong>’s management is committed to ensuring the well being of our workers and the environment, as well as people living and working in communities near our facilities. Human, physical and financial resources will be provided to meet this commitment. These resources are used to enable employees and contractors to work safely and comply with the law, to prevent pollution and to protect the environment.<br/><br/>
 
Project managers will assess the health, environment and safety (HES) risks of their operations. Managers and staff are responsible and accountable for developing and implementing standards, guidelines and procedures to carry out this commitment in accordance with our Code of Conduct, our corporate policies. Managers will include measurable goals in their business plans to continually improve HES performance.<br/><br/>

<strong>MEX Canada</strong>’s activities are subject to many HES laws and regulations addressing releases to air, discharges to water, disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes, transportation of hazardous materials, management of chemical substances and emergency planning. Worldwide, employees are expected to comply fully with company policies and to adhere, at a minimum, to the applicable HES legal requirements of their host country. Regulations, such as those issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and similar agencies in other locations, contain exacting requirements and standards that set the minimum legal standards for <strong>MEX Canada</strong>’s facilities and employees in the country where the referenced regulations apply. Industry recommended practices provide additional guidance to help local management set standards for the unique conditions at each facility.<br/><br/>

All necessary permits and agency approvals must be obtained prior to facility construction, and followed during fabrication, installation and startup. HES requirements must be assessed in all phases of a project from design through operation. HES requirements must also be considered in facility modifications, business or property acquisitions and divestitures and facility closures.</p>
								<h3>Harassment</h3>
								<p><strong>MEX Canada</strong> is committed to providing its employees with a work environment free of any type of harassment. Various country’s legislation prohibit any deliberate discrimination or harassment, in word or action, against a fellow employee or applicant for employment on the basis of race, gender, sexual preference, national origin, religion, or age. If a country has no harassment laws in place, MEX Canada’s  Code of Conduct and compliance program will provide guidance for addressing harassment situations.<br/><br/>
 
Forms of harassment include: (a) verbal harassment, such as derogatory comments, jokes or slurs; (b) physical harassment, such as unnecessary or offensive touching, or impeding or blocking movement; and (c) visual harassment, such as derogatory or offensive posters, cards, calendars, cartoons, graffiti, drawings, messages, notes or gestures.<br/>
Sexual harassment consists of unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: (a) submission to such conduct is made a term or condition of an individual's employment; (b) submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for employment decisions; or (c) such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.<br/><br/>
 
Any employee who violates these laws or the standards and practices described above will be subject to disciplinary action. If you believe that harassment by a co-worker, supervisor or person doing business with or for the company has occurred, you should notify your immediate supervisor and/or Human Resources department. Complaints will be handled in a confidential manner, and no individual will suffer any reprisals for reporting any incidents of harassment or for making any complaints. If the complaint involves an immediate supervisor, it should be directed to the next higher level of supervision. The complaint can also be directed to the human resources manager. Employees may also call the Compliance Alert Line.<br/><br/>
 
Harassment complaints will be investigated and appropriate action will be taken in accordance with the results of that investigation. Any employee, who is found to be responsible for sexual harassment, or any other illegal form of harassment, will be subject to appropriate discipline, up to and including termination of employment. The severity of the disciplinary action will be based upon the circumstances of the infraction.</p>
							<h3>Moral Turpitude</h3>
							<p><strong>MEX Canada</strong> operates in many international communities and values its business reputation and those of its suppliers, partners and associates. In this regard employees, consultants and suppliers are required to act in the best interests of the Company and engage in no activity that is detrimental or prejudicial to the Company its reputation or any of its businesses in the conduct of his/her personal affairs on a continuous 24 hour daily basis for the duration of employment or contract and conform to standards of good citizenship and good moral character and agrees not to engage in acts of moral turpitude.<br/><br/>
 
Everything done contrary to justice, honesty, modesty or good morals, is done with turpitude. The solicitation or engagement of prostitutes or public displays of inappropriate promiscuity are acts of moral turpitude as defined by this Code of Conduct.</p>
							<h3>Equal Employment Opportunity</h3>
							<p><strong>MEX Canada</strong> employees represent many nationalities and have diverse backgrounds and experience. We are committed to building a work environment where all employees are treated with dignity and respect.<br/>
<strong>MEX Canada</strong> is committed to providing equal opportunity to all qualified individuals in recruitment, compensation, development, promotion and other employment practices. All personnel actions and company-sponsored programs shall be administered on a non-discriminatory basis while ensuring compliance with labour law and nationalization requirements in each country where we operate.<br/><br/>
 
<strong>MEX Canada</strong> is committed to compliance with equal employment opportunity laws. Ensuring equal employment opportunity in a global setting can be challenging. The laws regulating equal employment opportunity vary from country to country. Immigration and work permit regulations and the nationalization policies of many countries may require that persons of a particular nationality are given priority in recruitment or promotion.<br/><br/>

<strong>MEX Canada</strong> complies with Government regulations prohibiting discrimination against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, color, religion, ethnic or national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or age. This applies to recruitment, compensation, training, promotion and other employment practices. Discrimination against any employee or applicant for employment is a serious violation of <strong>MEX Canada</strong>’s corporate policy and of equal employment opportunity laws in many countries. It is the responsibility of every supervisory employee to ensure that all employees are treated fairly.<br/><br/>
 
Employees who have questions or complaints arising under this standard can discuss the matter with their supervisors, their human resources managers or with other appropriate management officials. If an employee feels unable to talk to a supervisor, human resources manager or management official, an employee may call the Compliance Alert Line.</p>
						<h3>Conflict of Interest</h3>
						<p>"Conflict of Interest" generally describes situations where an employee's own interest may influence the way he or she handles company business. It usually involves a situation where an employee or an employee's family members can benefit personally from transactions involving the company.
While a possible conflict between personal interests and company interests does not always result in damage to the company, its very existence creates an inappropriate condition. Even the appearance of a conflict of interest should be avoided. It is not possible to describe all instances where a conflict of interest could occur. However, the guidelines following help define a potential conflict of interest.<br/><br/>
 
A conflict of interest can exist when an employee or family member has a direct or indirect financial interest in, or receives any compensation or other benefit from, any individual or firm that:<br/>
 -sells material, equipment or property to the company;<br/>
 -renders any service to the company; <br/>
 -has contractual relations or business dealings with the company, including leases and purchases; or <br/>
-competes with or engages in a similar business as that of the company.<br/><br/>
 
A conflict of interest may also exist when an employee uses company equipment, personnel or facilities for personal gain. Financial interests in businesses do not include ownership of stock in corporations listed on a stock exchange, provided that the financial interest does not exceed one percent of the corporation's outstanding shares.
Company business must be conducted solely on the basis of merit and open competition. Employees must refrain from actions that might impair their independent judgment or provide an unfair advantage to a contractor. The following illustrates some of the kinds of activities employees should avoid:</p>
						<h3>Loans</h3>
						<p>Employees should not borrow from the company's customers or from individuals or firms with which the company does business.</p>
						<h3>Gifts and Gratuities</h3>
						<p>Employees should not solicit gifts, services, benefits or hospitality from customers or suppliers. In addition, employees should not accept gifts, services, benefits or hospitality from customers and suppliers that might influence or appear to influence the employee's conduct in representing the company. Gifts and entertainment may be exchanged at a level that does not exceed customary courtesies extended in accordance with ethical business practices.<br/><br/>
 
The Human Resource Department of <strong>MEX Canada</strong> shall provide gift and entertainment guidelines for general guidance. Check with your supervisor for further explanation of what constitutes inappropriate gifts and entertainment in your specific area of operations.
Information Employees should not disclose or use for their own benefit, or the benefit of anyone other than the company, information that is not known to the general public. Such information includes reports, internal memoranda, technical data, financial data, operating data and other information regarding the company's business and operational activities and future plans.</p>
						<h3>Payments</h3>
						<p>Employees should not make illegal, questionable or unauthorized payments of money or other forms of payment including property to anyone.</p>
						<h3>Employment</h3>
						<p>Employees should not perform work or render services for an organization that competes with the company or a company with which <strong>MEX Canada</strong> does business without appropriate approval from management.<br/> 
If you or a family member is engaged in activities that create or even appear to create a conflict of interest, you must immediately provide all pertinent information to your supervisor. The supervisor will then send the information to the Compliance Alert Line for concurrence or additional guidance on how to address the conflict appropriately.</p>
						<h3>Confidential Information</h3>
						<p>Confidential information may include various kinds of information, but certainly includes internal, confidential, proprietary or secret information related to <strong>MEX Canada</strong>’s business. Most of <strong>MEX Canada</strong>’s technology and much of our other know-how and experience are protected as trade secrets. Such trade secrets are valuable assets. Other examples of confidential information include processes, computer passwords and software, product formulations, business forecasts, plans and strategies, and information concerning our operations, customers and vendors.<br/><br/>
 
Confidential information may also be received from other companies or individuals in the course of MEX Canada’s business. <strong>MEX Canada</strong> employees must not disclose confidential information to anyone outside of the Company without specific authorization. Unauthorized disclosures (sometimes called "theft" or "misappropriation") may result in a loss of the value of the trade secrets and may constitute a crime or amount to a breach of contract.<br/><br/>
 
Selected human resource and personnel information must be kept strictly confidential and used only for the purpose for which it is intended.
Accordingly, no employee is to disclose any confidential information about <strong>MEX Canada</strong> or others without authorization. This applies both during employment and afterwards.</p>
					<h3>Corrupt Practices</h3>
					<p><strong>MEX Canada</strong> strives to deal with all of its customers, suppliers and government agencies in a straightforward and aboveboard manner and in strict compliance with the requirements of the international anti-bribery conventions and local anti-corruption and bribery laws.<br/><br/>
 
Employees are prohibited from paying any bribe, kickback or other similar unlawful payment to any public official, or government, or other individual, regardless of nationality, to secure any concession, contract or improper advantage for <strong>MEX Canada</strong> or the employee.<br/><br/>
 
Certain nominal payments to public or government officials may be allowable if they are in compliance with local laws, and are in the nature of facilitating or expediting payment that is made to secure the performance of a "routine governmental action." Routine governmental action is usually of a ministerial nature and commonly performed by a public official. This does not include any decision by a public official to award new business or continue business with a particular party. The factual circumstances of each case, and the applicable laws that may vary from country to country, will determine the legality or illegality of such payments.<br/><br/>
 
Therefore, you must not make any such payment until you receive the express prior approval of your supervisor and the Company’s legal counsel to ensure legal compliance.<br/><br/>
 
No undisclosed or unrecorded fund or asset of MEX Canada may be established. Payments on behalf of <strong>MEX Canada</strong> can be made only on the basis of adequate supporting documentation, may be made only for the purpose described by the documents supporting the payment, and must be made in accordance with appropriate corporate accounting procedures.<br/><br/>
 
Agreements with <strong>MEX Canada</strong>’s representatives and partners who engage in activities on behalf of, or together with, <strong>MEX Canada</strong>, that may involve governments or government officials, must be in writing. It is advisable to do background checks on foreign agents and representatives. The Company’s legal counsel for compliance must review agreements with such representatives in advance.<br/><br/>
 
Any questions or doubts about the propriety of a proposed course of action should be discussed with the Company’s legal counsel before taking the action in question. Any suspected violations of this Code of Conduct, Corrupt Practices or local law must be reported promptly to the Company’s legal counsel.<br/><br/>
 
We expect that decisions of government officials, customers and suppliers of <strong>MEX Canada</strong> will always be based on the merits of a particular project. <strong>MEX Canada</strong> and its employees should always advocate their understanding of what those merits might be, but such advocacy must always be able to withstand full public scrutiny.</p>
							<h3>Patents & Intellectual Property</h3>
							<p>Corporate assets include not only tangible and real property but also intellectual property, (or IP) IP is proprietary business or technical information of value protected by patent, trademark, copyright or trade secret laws. It is in <strong>MEX Canada</strong>’s interest to protect and maintain its IP, do nothing to jeopardize its value, and thus be positioned for maximum return for its use or purchase. Senior management has the ultimate responsibility for IP issues arising from matters under its control.
 
Before any Company project or subsidiary undertakes a course of action involving the intellectual property of <strong>MEX Canada</strong> or another company, the Company’s legal counsel should review the proposed course of action. This procedure is mandatory for matters pertaining to inventions, patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and to contracts involving: 
 -a license, sale, purchase or disclosure of proprietary information; 
 -software development of any kind, or a software purchase or license costing more than $10,000 per copy or $50,000 in the aggregate; 
 -confidentiality of technical or business information; 
 -consulting or service arrangements where the development of new technical information or the divulging of proprietary information can be foreseen; 
 -joint venture relationships where the development of new or improved technology is expected; or 
 -research work, development or programs.
 
Just as the company regards its patents, trade secrets, trademarks and copyrights as valuable corporate assets, we must respect the valid IP rights of other companies and persons. When the Company desires to receive, use, or purchase the IP of another party, the legitimate bounds of such property should be identified and appropriate legal counsel obtained for any proposed course of action. The company will not knowingly infringe on others' patents, trademarks or copyrights, or misappropriate others' trade secrets, or the like. Procedures for the proper licensing or other permitted use of these assets as set forth herein must be followed by all employees. Of particular importance to day-to-day operations, and something that must be avoided by each employee, is the unauthorized copying of magazine and journal articles, books, computer software or any other copyrighted material. For further information regarding IP issues, please refer to the Company’s legal counsel.</p>
							<h3>Making the System Work</h3>
							<p><b>ALL EMPLOYEES</b> of <strong>MEX Canada</strong> and its wholly owned subsidiaries are expected to follow this Code of Conduct in their day-to-day activities.

Failure by any employee to disclose violations of these standards and practices by other <strong>MEX Canada</strong> employees or contract workers is also grounds for disciplinary action</p>

This Code of Conduct will also continue to be reviewed regularly, with any updates made available to employees, as well as shared with our external stakeholders.<br/><br/>
 
Employees shall have several resources available to assist them with compliance questions and concerns. The employee will be able to freely discuss this matter with their immediate supervisor. If the employee prefers, the individual can consult with the Human Resources department, Auditor, member of the Senior Management Team or the Compliance Alert Line.<br/><br/>

Employees who call the Compliance Alert Line do not have to identify themselves but must leave sufficient detailed information to enable a proper review to be conducted. Employee anonymity is strictly protected.<br/><br/>
 
<strong>MEX Canada</strong> will not discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass or in any manner discriminate against any employee in the terms and conditions of employment based upon any lawful actions of such employee with respect to good faith reporting of complaints.</p>

								<h3>MEDICAL PLANNING:   FOR THE BUSINESS OF HEALTHCARE DELIVERY</h3><img src="images/image667.jpg" alt="image667" width="453" height="340" align="right">
								<p>At its best, a comprehensive Medical Planning that includes very detailed Medical Program & Functional Space Program will result in the design and construction of an integrated patient care delivery system that meets immediate operational objectives while providing a reasonable measure of accommodation to changing future circumstances.<br/><br/>
 
When one hears about a "poorly designed" facility, one is generally learning of a failure, not so much of the Architecture per se, but of the Medical Programming & Functional Space Programming that preceded the design.<br/><br/>
 
There is a ‘<b>Paradigm Shift</b>’ in Strategies that inherently relies on the ‘Big Picture’ Concept where in the  ‘Singular entity—The Hospital’ approach gives way to an ‘INTEGRATED & NETWORKED HEALTH DELIVERY SYSTEM’ approach.<br/><br/>

The Hospital Facility operations thus become just one of the activities within a healthcare delivery system, as is evident from the graphic.<br/><br/>
 
Some of the world’s most successful institutions in private healthcare have adopted and successfully implemented this approach.<br/><br/><img src="images/image15001.gif" alt="image15001" width="454" height="350" align="right">
 
The Integrated & Networked Healthcare Delivery System approach allows for and assists to successfully introduce and implement a new model of care, called ‘PATIENT FOCUSSED CARE’;  thus  centralizing most elements of patient care at the bedside.<br/><br/>

 
The bedside is the treatment centre with the patient being looked after by a multi-skilled care team, dedicated to that person during the hospital stay.  Services such as radiology, pharmacy, cleaning, delivery of food, admission and discharge procedures have been brought close to the patient bedside, rather than being at one central location.<br/><br/>
 
The Integrated & Networked Healthcare Delivery System approach also allows the community the financial mechanisms to access world-class quality private healthcare services through market competitive health-plans provided by the system itself; thus ensuring a continuum of quality care for individuals and families.</p>

<p> 
<b>METHODOLOGY</b><br/>
We believe the success of our research, healthcare and academic facilities are grounded in rigorous adherence to a proven methodology that is itself centred on the particular requirements of each institution. All phases of the project revolve around the client and users, and we are confident that the Ministry of Health will appreciate our delivery methodology. All our medical projects follow the following process:<br/><br/>

<b>1.0 PRE-DESIGN:</b><br/>
1.1 Master Plan Review<br/> 
1.2 Program Verification / Validation<br/><br/>

In Pre-Design, the long-term and short-term goals form the backbone for solutions to ensure the stated program yields the spatial and functional relationships needed for a successful design.<br/><br/> 

Objectives:<br/>
• Analyze & update/modify/value-add to program<br/>
• Establish the project parameters including expansion limits<br/>
• Establish base building footprint and floor plates<br/>
• Test program departmental square footage<br/><img src="images/image665.jpg" alt="image665" width="453" height="261" align="right">
• Establish primary building access locations and linkages between building<br/>
• Develop vertical (floor) dimension alternatives<br/>
• Establish drawings and manual formats<br/>
• Establish master zoning program (departmental)<br/><br/>

Idea sessions are also used to capture all the core values and ideas held by the facilities’ key stakeholders. The outcome of this session is a prioritized listing of the functional, operational, aesthetic, and cultural criteria that influences the development of the campus.<br/><br/>

<b>1.1 Master Plan Review</b><br/>
The Master Planning process will address both the short and long-range aspects of the development of the facility. During the planning activities focusing on the short-term aspects, solutions will be developed that solve the immediate priorities and strategic goals of the Client.<br/><br/> 

Issues such as the direction of growth, consolidation of entrances, future centres of excellence, outpatient care focus, etc., are immediate concerns but will rely heavily upon the long-range vision of the Client.<br/><br/>

The Master Planning activities that address long-range considerations are by nature more of an anticipatory planning process driven more by a strategic vision than present reality. Assumptions about future research facility utilizations, the need to organize as product lines or centres of excellence, and future market demands or shifts play important planning roles. Decisions made as to the short-range solutions also heavily influence long-range direction. The Master Plan which is developed must be flexible enough to meld the known short-range goals with the anticipated long-range goals of the institution.<br/><br/>

<b>1.1.1 Project Mobilization and Organization</b><br/><img src="images/image8191.jpg" alt="image8191" width="454" height="353" align="right">
Objectives of this task include:<br/>
• Identification of team members and roles<br/>
• Establishment of communications protocol<br/>
• Confirmation of schedules and work plans<br/>
• Confirmation of budget(s)<br/>
• Confirmation of objectives / expectations<br/><br/>

<b>1.1.2 Idea Session</b>
This session serves as the catalyst for defining the goals and aspiration of the Ministry of Health. There is no attempt to discuss quantitative data, physical layout, and perceived solutions. This is a session about ideas. Everyone will be encouraged to discuss their vision. All ideas will be recorded and evaluated by the group. This group will then be asked to prioritize the ideas to assist in providing us with a benchmark from which all future decisions can be weighed.<br/><br/>

The outcome of this session is a prioritized listing of the functional, operational, aesthetic, and cultural criteria that influences the development of the facility.<br/><br/>

<b>1.1.3 Data Collection</b>
An important initial task is the review of existing and applicable information that will impact the planning of the hospitals in general and specifically the project under review:<br/><img src="images/image531.jpg" alt="image531" width="453" height="310" align="right">
• Ministry of Health’s strategic plan<br/>
• Site survey and geotechnical information<br/>
• Municipal zoning requirements<br/>
• Traffic patterns into and around the site<br/>
• View corridors within and into the site<br/>
• Historic and projected utilization and volumes<br/><br/>

<b>1.1.4 Macro Program</b>
The macro program will define in broad terms the long-range space and program requirements. The Design Team will translate the project vision and the program into a statement that can be used to develop adjacency, sizing and massing arrangements for the various programmatic elements. It is not the intent to develop detailed physical space requirements for the individual departments but rather to understand the "order of magnitude", size, relationships, and arrangement of the various components and/or services at the facility.<br/><br/>

<b>1.1.5 Site Master Plan Review (Architectural and Engineering)</b>
The results of our idea session, data collection and macro program efforts will be combined to form the parameters for the Master Plan review. Opportunities and constraints will be identified and documented. The following issues will be reviewed:<br/><img src="images/image3491.jpg" alt="image3491" width="454" height="357" align="right">
• Image and identity<br/>
• Land use / functional zoning<br/>
• Expansion potential<br/>
• Site access<br/>
• Site amenities<br/>
• Parking<br/>
• Views<br/>
• Building relationships and connections<br/><br/>

<b>1.2 Program Verification / Validation</b><br/>
This process involves the review and analysis of the preliminary program, and the testing of the program and assumptions.<br/><br/>

<b>1.2.1 Orientation</b><br/>
The first step is to define the team members or users for the various departments. The user groups should consist of representatives from senior administration, facilities management, medical staff, and nursing. The individuals chosen for these groups should be able to maintain a broad perspective of the goals of the Ministry of Health and at the same time, have a working knowledge of their individual department or clinical area. It is important that in the selection of users, consideration be given to the ability of that individual to be involved throughout the project implementation process. The continuity of users will allow the process to proceed smoothly.<br/><br/>

In addition, the confirmation of the schedule, milestone dates, tasks and deliverables will be determined. This is important to establish at the onset of the project to allow all team members to "clear" their calendars on key dates.<br/><br/><img src="images/image8181.gif" alt="image8181" width="454" height="340" align="right">

<b>1.2.2 Functional Space Program Validation</b><br/>
An essential element in the development of any project is the detailed space and functional program requirements. The program is derived from:<br/>
• Historic and projected utilization volumes<br/>
• Patient and family encounter expectations<br/>
• Technology interface with telemedicine, medical records, imaging, etc.<br/>
• Staff work flow and processes<br/>
• Logistics / materials management<br/><br/>

The master-plan review phase provides the Client with the framework for organizing the facility. The programming effort will seek to elicit responses by the individual departments related to supporting these goals. The challenge is to create an ideal work environment rather than perpetuate the "we've always done it this way" paradigm. The detailed space and functional program review will serve as the basis for establishing the scope of the project.<br/><br/>

<b>1.2.3 Functional Adjacency Diagrams</b><br/><img src="images/image15201.jpg" alt="image15201" width="454" height="357" align="right">
This task translates the quantitative program into qualitative design and planning options. The overriding aspects of patient / staff / service circulation, interdepartmental relationships, image and quality of space issues will be reviewed. Conceptual diagrams will be developed. <br/>
The objective of this phase is to challenge your way of thinking and through this process, establish a concept that is reflective of the vision. The final conceptual design will serve as the organizing framework for the detailed development of the project.<br/><br/>

Once the program and functional adjacencies are established, room-by-room layouts can be prepared.<br/><br/>

<b>2.0 SCHEMATIC DESIGN:</b><br/> 
2.1 Schematic Design Documents <br/>
2.2 Operational and Facilities Maintenance<br/>
2.3 Aesthetic and Design Issues <br/><br/>

During the Schematic Design phase the selected master plan, function adjacency plans and overall design are refined and the scale and relationships among the components of the project is developed. The primary objective is to clearly define the design concept in terms of the project goals. This phase also presents the opportunity to test and clarify the building program and further explore the most promising design solution.<br/><br/>

<b>2.1 Schematic Design Documents</b>
Focusing on the functional relationships and adjacencies of the individual spaces within the facility, functional issues such as the ones listed below will be reviewed:<br/><img src="images/image3211.gif" alt="image3211" width="454" height="291" align="right">
• Travel distances<br/>
• Where and how the patient is greeted<br/>
• How the patient is escorted to / through the department<br/>
• Location of staff work areas, etc.<br/><br/>

<b>2.2 Operational and Facilities Maintenance</b><br/>
Areas that would be reviewed:<br/>
• Mechanical systems<br/>
• Electrical systems<br/>
• Telecommunications<br/>
• Security<br/><br/>                              
                                                                           
<b>2.3 Aesthetic and Design Issues</b><br/>
Issues to be discussed:<br/>
• Image and identity<br/>
• Building materials<br/><img src="images/image14271.gif" alt="image14271" width="454" height="340" align="right">
• Natural light<br/>
• Use of lighting<br/><br/>

<b>3.0 DESIGN DEVELOPMENT:</b><br/><br/>

<b>3.1 Design Development Documents</b><br/> 
Based on approval of Schematic Design, the Design team will further develop the design. Design development documents will be prepared consisting of drawings and other documents to fix and describe the dimensions and character of the project as to architectural systems and materials.<br/><br/>

During this phase, the building elevations and individual rooms are developed in a fairly detailed manner. Finishes, medical equipment, casework, telecommunications and data locations and criteria are also defined. The user groups will need to be augmented to include clinicians / nurses, facilities, housekeeping, maintenance, and bio-medical engineering.<br/><br/>


<b>4.0 CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTATION:</b><br/><img src="images/image14321.jpg" alt="image14321" width="454" height="339" align="right">
This phase will comprise of comprehensive set of documents prepared from the approved design development documents. The quality of documentation will be to first class international standards based on Canadian practice, and to Vancouver building standard codes.<br/><br/>

<b>4.1 Construction Documents</b><br/>
• Site Plans<br/>
• Floor Plans<br/>
• Roof Plans<br/>
• Elevations<br/>
• Sections<br/>
• Electrical<br/>
• Mechanical<br/>
• Plumbing<br/>
• Fixed and Loose Furniture Layout & Details<br/>
• Landscape<br/>
• Specifications<br/>
• Door Schedules<br/>
• Window Schedules<br/>
• Finish Schedules<br/><br/>

<b>5.0 CONTRACT ADMINISTRATION:</b> <br/>
During construction, regular meetings, site visits, and appropriate instruction is provided to ensure the facility—and all associated systems—come together according to the construction plans.<br/><br/>

<b>5.1 Construction Administration</b><br/>
Design Team will provide periodic review of work on site. If full time supervision is required, this would be on the basis of the cost of the architectural representative on site would be added to the overall fee.<br/>
